# polyhedraldice
Addons are here for creating polyhedral dice in Blender! These models can be used with any font to 3D print and make molds to produce your own click clack rocks!
As always, make sure the fonts you’re using are free for your purposes or that you have the appropriate license. 
If these have been helpful for you,, you are welcome to send me a tip on PayPal at PayPal.Me/amspringer. 
Contact me at killyourdarlings@gmail.com with questions or to purchase custom STL files to print your masters.
